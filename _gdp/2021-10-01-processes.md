<h1>The nine quality processes of a project</h1>

<h2>Review of different processes</h2>

<h3>Requirement Definition</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In this process, we need to define the requirements of the project and analyze them. Those requirements need to
be defined regarding the “Business Processes” of the company. For this we need to have:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The “As is” situation</li>
  <li>The “To be” situation</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The work that need to be done after is in two steps:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Step 1: Define all the requirements that cover the business processes of the company. At this level we are not “Solution dependent”</li>
  <li>
    Step 2: See after, regarding the Solution/Implementation chosen, how each requirement is full fill
    <ul>
      <li>OOTB (Out Of The Box)</li>
      <li>Configuration</li>
      <li>Customization</li>
      <li>Not possible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The goal is really to minimize the “Customization”, in a way to have a more standard Solution, that will be
easily maintain from time to time, when the upgrade of the core solution will occur along the life of the software. It’s
a good KPI to have the % of Customization, in a way to present the project. A goal below 5% is a good average, knowing
that we exclude from this number the migration, which is by default customized to full fill the customer data.
