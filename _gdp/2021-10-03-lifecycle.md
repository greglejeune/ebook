  In this process, you will define how the development of your Solution will be done. You will decide if you have a more standard approach (V-Model), a more Agile approach or a combined. You need to address here as well the “Release Process” that define the way how you package your different release/delivery. This last part is strongly connected with the Configuration Management, where you need to store your work, and have some predictable / repeatable processes for delivery and installation.
